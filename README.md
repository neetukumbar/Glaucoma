# Glaucoma
Android Based Glaucoma Detection Using X-AI
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of glaucoma from retinal images. The model is built using transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 architecture and is fine-tuned on a custom dataset. A key feature of this project is the use of Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize and interpret the model's predictions, providing insight into which parts of the image are most influential in the final classification.

The project includes scripts for data loading and augmentation, model training and evaluation, and a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio for real-time inference and visualization.
